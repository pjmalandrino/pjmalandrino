//! Integer-coordinate construction of the Leech lattice Λ₂₄.
//!
//! Following LLVQ (arXiv:2603.11021, §2.3, Eq. 4–5) we work in the integer
//! embedding `√8·Λ₂₄ ⊂ Z²⁴`: a vector `x ∈ Z²⁴` belongs to the (scaled)
//! Leech lattice iff
//!
//! | | even coset | odd coset |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | (i) parity | `xᵢ ≡ 0 (mod 2)` ∀i | `xᵢ ≡ 1 (mod 2)` ∀i |
//! | (ii) Golay | `{i : xᵢ ≡ 2 (mod 4)} ∈ G₂₄` | `{i : xᵢ ≡ 3 (mod 4)} ∈ G₂₄` |
//! | (iii) sum | `Σxᵢ ≡ 0 (mod 8)` | `Σxᵢ ≡ 4 (mod 8)` |
//!
//! With the `1/√8` normalization the lattice is even and unimodular; the
//! `m`-th shell `{v : ‖v‖² = 2m}` corresponds to `‖x‖² = 16m` in the
//! integer embedding. The minimal shell is `m = 2` (`‖x‖² = 32`) with
//! 196 560 vectors — the kissing number of Λ₂₄ — which the G1 test-suite
//! reproduces by exhaustive, membership-verified enumeration.
//!
//! ## Exactness domain
//!
//! Every function in this module is exact over the **entire** `[i32; 24]`
//! domain: `norm2` accumulates in `i128` (24·(2³¹)² < 2⁶⁷), `shell_index`
//! returns a `u64` quotient that always fits, and `add`/`neg` use checked
//! arithmetic — a coordinate overflow panics instead of silently returning
//! a *different*, valid-looking lattice point (an `i32` wraparound is a
//! congruence mod 2³², which all three membership constraints — mod 2, 4
//! and 8 — would fail to detect).
